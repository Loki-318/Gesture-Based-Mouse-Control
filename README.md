# Gesture-Based-Mouse-Control

**NOTE: Works with Python 3.11 or 3.12 only. It is not compatible with 3.13 yet.**
1. Install the required libraries by running
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the `build_app.bat` file by double clicking on it.
3. Wait for the build to complete
4. Once completed, you can find the executable file in the `dist/GestureControl` path.
5. Before running the executable file, go to `dist/GestureControl/_internal/mediapipe` and check if `modules` folder has been created. If not, I have added that folder in this repo. So once you have cloned the repo, cut the `modules` folder and paste it in `dist/GestureControl/_internal/mediapipe`. 
6. Run the executable file `GestureControl.exe` and you should see a window opening in the background which access your camera.
7. Provide access if required.

If any issues, let me know. 
Hopefully it works well and will be useful to you peeps. :)
